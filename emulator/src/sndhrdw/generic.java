/***************************************************************************

  Many games use a master-slave CPU setup. Typically, the main CPU writes
  a command to some register, and then writes to another register to trigger
  an interrupt on the slave CPU (the interrupt might also be triggered by
  the first write). The slave CPU, notified by the interrupt, goes and reads
  the command.

  Currently, MAME doesn't interleave the execution of the two CPUs: they run
  alternatively for one complete video frame (~50000 clock cycles for a 3Mhz
  CPU). This could lead to data loss if the main CPU sends a quick sequence
  of commands. To avoid that, we use a buffer.
